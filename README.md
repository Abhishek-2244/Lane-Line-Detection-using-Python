# Lane-Line-Detection-using-Python
Lane Line Detection using Python
This project demonstrates lane line detection in images and videos using Python and computer vision techniques. The goal is to identify and draw lane lines on the road, aiding in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

Features
Lane line detection in images and videos
Detection of straight lane lines
Handling of curved lane lines
Robustness to variations in lighting and road conditions
Visualization of detected lane lines on the original images/videos
Interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time lane line detection
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
